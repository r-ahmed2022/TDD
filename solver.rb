  def factorial(N)
    # Create a method called factorial that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns the factorial for that number. The factorial is the multiplication of all integers from 1 to N and has the special case that the factorial of 0 is 1. This method only accepts 0 and positive integers, so if a negative integer is given it should raise an exception.
